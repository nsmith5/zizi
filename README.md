_ðŸ¦‰ A little cloud just for you_

We use a lot of cloud services daily. Which is to say we use other people
computers to do stuff.  This might be hosting our files, email, website, social
media etc. The `zizi` project aims to make it possible to do some of that
yourself, on your own server, in a very basic way.
